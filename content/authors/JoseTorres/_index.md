I am a neurobiologist interested on the epigenetic landscape regulating neural development and its impact on neurodegenerative disorders. I have been successfully involved in a wide range of multi-disciplinary projects spanning from clinical settings to academic scenarios with engineers/materials scientists and experimental psychologists. 

I gained my undergraduate degree in Biology at the University of Valencia and then moved to Oxford for a 6-month internship at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics. After that, I did a MRes in Neuroscience at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. For my PhD in Clinical Medicine Research, I worked with Dr Istvan Nagy at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, Imperial College London. I investigated the role different epigenetic tags, mainly histone post-translational modifications, play on the transition from acute to chronic pain at neurons and glial cells of both spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia. 

I held two postdoctoral positions at Queen Mary University of London.  First at the School of Engineering and Materials Science, where I was performing high-resolution electrophysiology of primary cilia and single cell calcium recordings. Secondly, at the School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, where I used zebrafish as a reverse genetic model for comparative cognition. I generated loss-of-function zebrafish lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, performed differential gene expression analysis, and conducted behavioural analysis.
