bio: After graduate from Imperial College's MSc in Applied Mathematics, Leo worked at Echo State (one of Sweden’s fastest growing Data Science/Engineering consultancy startups) working on projects spanning data engineering, data science, and the development of machine learning models. He was involved planning and implementation of a data lake/data warehouse project in Microsoft Azure working with data ingestion, transformation and presentation. As part of his masters programme, he applied a combination of hidden Markov models and deep convolutional networks to find cell-cycle transitions in time-lapse microscopy videos of cancer cells. In the Neurogenomics lab, he's now bringing his mathematics and machine learning expertise to bear on biology.
