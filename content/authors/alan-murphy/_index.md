I have a background in data analytics and machine learning, undertaking my undergraduate degree in Trinity College Dublin. I gained three years of experience in industry, working as a data analytics consultant on numerous statistical projects across a wide range of industries from the public sector to banking.

More recently, I worked as part of Dr. Overton's group in Queen's University Belfast. My research focused on methods of integrating multi-omic patient data, through network biology approaches, to predict the instigated molecular players in differing biological contexts such as the Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) process. 

My research goal is to apply machine learning techniques, through systems biology approaches, to further our understanding into the drivers of multi-factorial diseases. My current role as a research assistant in Dr. Nathan Skene's group, focuses on the analysis of multi-omic single-cell data in neurodegenerative diseases.
