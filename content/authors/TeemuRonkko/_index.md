I finished my MSc degree in Bioinformatics at the University of Copenhagen in 2021 after which I spent a year working as a civil servant at <a href="https://www.hus.fi/en/about-us/patient-care-quality-and-patient-safety/hus-diagnostic-center">HUS Diagnostic Center</a> in Helsinki, Finland. I am especially interested in the use of machine learning methods to increase our understanding of mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.
