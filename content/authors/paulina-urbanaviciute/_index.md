After studying topics in bioinformatics and genomics throughout my BSc degree in Biochemistry, I felt motivated to purse an MSc in Applied Genomics. Interest in neuroscience led me to the neurogenomics lab to complete my 6-month MSc project, focusing on the allele-specific histone acetylation in Alzheimer’s disease under the supervision of Sarah Marzi. 

As of November 2022, I continue in the Marzi lab as a research technician with the aim of finalising my MSc project analyses, as well as collaborating with other researchers to identify transposable elements associated with Alzheimer’s disease and chromatin accessibility profiles associated with pesticide exposure in Parkinson’s disease.
