*I am currently an MSc Applied Genomics student at Imperial College London. My interests lie in genetics and bioinformatics, which I specialised in during my BSc Biochemistry studies at Imperial. I  focussed my thesis on antimicrobial resistance evolution in tuberculosis, where I gained experience in statistical analysis using sequencing data. Curiosity for complex genetic diseases lead me to my current Master’s course and the neurogenomics lab, where I will be identifying allelic biases for epigenetics in Alzheimer’s disease under the supervision of Dr Sarah Marzi.*
