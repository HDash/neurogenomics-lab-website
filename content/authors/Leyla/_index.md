I am currently undertaking an MSc in Applied Genomics at Imperial. I previously obtained an integrated Master’s degree in Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry at the University of Oxford, dedicating my final year project to the investigation of the mechanisms of transcription and processing of snRNA genes. My interest in neuropsychiatric conditions was first piqued during my studentship at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, where I worked with the computational genomics group to gain insights into genetic basis of schizophrenia. I was also inspired by the utility of applying computational approaches to solving complex biological problems and now look forward to establishing a stronger foundation in bioinformatics, with a particular focus on using single-cell epigenetic data to help disentangle cell type-specific contributions to brain disorders.
