# Postdoctoral researchers

We are looking to recruit talented researchers to join the lab. Currently we are looking for two postdocs.

## Epigenetics postdoc

We're looking for someone that will be able to apply **epigenetics methods** to disassociated **single cells** and FACS sorted populations of nuclei. Wetlab experience working with genomic methods (e.g. DNA or RNA) is the primary criteria for this position.  Experience working with **post-mortem human brain** would be beneficial but is not required.

## Computational biology postdocs. 

Are you a computational researchers that cares about **reproducible research** and believes in the value of open-source code? Then get in touch about this position! The project will involve working with data generated from single cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq or post-mortem human brain tissue. The focus will be on using the data to interpret the results of **human genetics** studies. Researchers with unconventional backgrounds would be welcome: if you've been working in **mathematics, engineering or computer science** and are looking to get into biology then do get in touch. Strong programming skills will be required.

# PhD student

## Open position in machine learning

We are currently looking to recruit a PhD student to work on machine learning. They will need a strong background in **mathematics, statistics, computer science** or other quantitative disciplines. The candidate will work with **single cell genomic** data generated in our lab, as well as large public datasets. They will develop new **machine learning** models and apply cutting-edge statistical approaches. Candidates are encouraged to contact Nathan (nskene@ic.ac.uk) with their CVs and a brief statement about research interests.

## Source for PhD funding

There are a number of sources for PhD scholarships at Imperial:

- <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/fees-and-funding/scholarships/presidents-phd-scholarships/">Presidents scholarship</a>. 50 highly competitive PhD studentships per year.
- <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-dtp-studentships">Medical Research Council DTC studentships</a>. Around 10 fully funded positions per year.
- <a href="https://ai4health.io/">UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in AI for Healthcare</a>. This program involves bringing AI researchers together with clinical researchers; we expect to be submitting project proposals with interested students.
- <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/fees-and-funding/scholarships/international-scholarship-collaborations/csc/">The China Scholarship Council (CSC) Scheme</a>. PhD funding exclusively for students from China.
- <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/fees-and-funding/scholarships/international-scholarship-collaborations/ims/">The Imperial Marshall Scholarship Scheme</a>. PhD/MSc funding exclusively for students from USA.
- <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/international-relations/cnrs-imperial-phd-joint-programme/">Imperial College London-CNRS PhD Joint Programme</a>. This recently established programe is focused on `Mathematics, data and their applications across all areas of science`. Students will spend half their time at Imperial and half at CNRS.


# Masters student

Get in touch about potential projects. We frequently take students from the <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/medicine/experimental-neuroscience/">MRes Experimental Neuroscience</a> and <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/medicine/translational-neuroscience/">MSc Translational Neuroscience</a> programmes at Imperial College. We're also happy to speak to students from programs at Imperial.

Whether you are at Imperial or not, if you have strong quantitative / computing skills then we will consider supervising remote projects: contact us if you wish to discuss potential projects.
