# Postdoctoral researchers

We are looking to recruit talented researchers to join the lab. Currently we are looking for two postdocs.

## Epigenetics postdoc

We're looking for someone that will be able to apply **epigenetics methods** to disassociated **single cells** and FACS sorted populations of nuclei. Wetlab experience working with genomic methods (e.g. DNA or RNA) is the primary criteria for this position.  Experience working with **post-mortem human brain** would be beneficial but is not required. Please apply via <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/jobs/description/MED02114/research-associate-epigenetics-uk-dementia-research-institute/">this link</a> but first, just drop us an email to express your interest.

## Computational biology postdocs. 

Are you a computational researchers that cares about **reproducible research** and believes in the value of open-source code? Then get in touch about this position! The project will involve working with data generated from single cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq or post-mortem human brain tissue. The focus will be on using the data to interpret the results of **human genetics** studies. Researchers with unconventional backgrounds would be welcome: if you've been working in **mathematics, engineering or computer science** and are looking to get into biology then do get in touch. Strong programming skills will be required.

## Postdoctoral Fellowship Funding

We're always happy to discuss applications for postdoctoral fellowships. A curated list of fellowships broken down by nationality of applicant and host is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J2M_tQgoqV4ivpfEClh9qs9f2KQN2O1G3Jpda2aoHfQ/edit#gid=0">available here</a>.

# PhD student

## Open position in machine learning

We are currently looking to recruit a PhD student to work on machine learning. They will need a strong background in **mathematics, statistics, computer science** or other quantitative disciplines. The candidate will work with **single cell genomic** data generated in our lab, as well as large public datasets. They will develop new **machine learning** models and apply cutting-edge statistical approaches. Candidates are encouraged to contact Nathan (nskene@ic.ac.uk) with their CVs and a brief statement about research interests. Further information about the position is available <a href="https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/using-machine-learning-to-predict-cell-type-specific-effects-of-genetic-variants-which-influence-genome-regulation/?p124070">here on FindAPhD</a>.

- <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/fees-and-funding/scholarships/international-scholarship-collaborations/csc/">The China Scholarship Council (CSC) Scheme</a>. PhD funding exclusively for students from China.
- <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/fees-and-funding/scholarships/international-scholarship-collaborations/ims/">The Imperial Marshall Scholarship Scheme</a>. PhD/MSc funding exclusively for students from USA.
- <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/international-relations/cnrs-imperial-phd-joint-programme/">Imperial College London-CNRS PhD Joint Programme</a>. This recently established programe is focused on 'Mathematics, data and their applications across all areas of science'. Students will spend half their time at Imperial and half at CNRS.

If you are interested in applying for these programmes then contact Nathan or Sarah to discuss your application.

# Masters student

Get in touch about potential projects. We frequently take students from the <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/medicine/experimental-neuroscience/">MRes Experimental Neuroscience</a> and <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/medicine/translational-neuroscience/">MSc Translational Neuroscience</a> programmes at Imperial College. We're also happy to speak to students from programs at Imperial.

Whether you are at Imperial or not, if you have strong quantitative / computing skills then we will consider supervising remote projects: contact us if you wish to discuss potential projects.
