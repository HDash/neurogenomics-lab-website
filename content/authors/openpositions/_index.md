# Postdoctoral Researchers

We are looking to recruit talented researchers to join the lab. Currently, we are looking for postdocs in **Epigenetics**, **Computational Biology**, and **Machine Learning**.

## Machine Learning Postdoc

The lab is likely to receive funding for a Machine Learning postdoc in late 2022/early 2023. If you're a computational researcher with strong skills in Machine Learning, please contact <a href="mailto:n.skene@imperial.ac.uk">Dr Nathan Skene</a> or <a href="mailto:s.marzi@imperial.ac.uk">Dr Sarah Marzi</a> to discuss this position.

## Epigenetics Postdoc

We're looking for someone that will be able to apply **epigenetics methods** to disassociated **single cells** and FACS sorted populations of nuclei. Wetlab experience working with genomic methods (e.g. DNA or RNA) is the primary criteria for this position.  Experience working with **post-mortem human brain** would be beneficial but is not required.

## Computational Biology Postdoc

Are you a computational researcher that cares about **reproducible research** and believes in the value of open-source code? Then get in touch about this position! The project will involve working with data generated from single cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq or post-mortem human brain tissue. The focus will be on using the data to interpret the results of **human genetics** studies. Researchers with unconventional backgrounds would be welcome: if you've been working in **mathematics, engineering or computer science** and are looking to get into biology then do get in touch. Strong programming skills will be required.

## Postdoctoral Fellowship Funding

We're always happy to discuss applications for postdoctoral fellowships. A curated list of fellowships broken down by nationality of applicant and host is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J2M_tQgoqV4ivpfEClh9qs9f2KQN2O1G3Jpda2aoHfQ/edit#gid=0">available here</a>. The programmes which will be of interest to most people are:

- <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/">Marie Curie actions</a>
- <a href="https://ibro.org/open-calls/">International Brain Research Organization</a>
- <a href="https://www.hfsp.org/">Human Frontiers</a>
- <a href="https://www.embo.org/">EMBO</a>
- <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/research-and-innovation/research-office/funder-information/research-fellowships/icrf/">Imperial College Research Fellowships</a>

Get in touch if you are interested in applying to one hosted by our lab. 

# PhD students

## Sources for PhD funding

There are a number of sources for PhD scholarships at Imperial:

- <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/fees-and-funding/scholarships/presidents-phd-scholarships/">Presidents scholarship</a>. 50 highly competitive PhD studentships per year.
- <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/multisci-mrc-dtp/">Medical Research Council MultiSci MRC DTC studentships</a>. Around 10 fully funded positions per year.
- <a href="https://ai4health.io/">UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in AI for Healthcare</a>. This program involves bringing AI researchers together with clinical researchers; we expect to be submitting project proposals with interested students.
- <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/fees-and-funding/scholarships/international-scholarship-collaborations/csc/">The China Scholarship Council (CSC) Scheme</a>. PhD funding exclusively for students from China.
- <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/fees-and-funding/scholarships/international-scholarship-collaborations/ims/">The Imperial Marshall Scholarship Scheme</a>. PhD/MSc funding exclusively for students from USA.
- <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/international-relations/cnrs-imperial-phd-joint-programme/">Imperial College London-CNRS PhD Joint Programme</a>. This recently established programe is focused on 'Mathematics, data and their applications across all areas of science'. Students will spend half their time at Imperial and half at CNRS.

If you are interested in applying for these programmes then contact Nathan or Sarah to discuss your application.

# Masters students

Get in touch about potential projects. We frequently take students from the <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/medicine/experimental-neuroscience/">MRes Experimental Neuroscience</a> and <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/medicine/translational-neuroscience/">MSc Translational Neuroscience</a> programmes at Imperial College. We're also happy to speak to students from programs at Imperial.

Whether you are at Imperial or not, if you have strong quantitative / computing skills then we will consider supervising remote projects: contact us if you wish to discuss potential projects.
