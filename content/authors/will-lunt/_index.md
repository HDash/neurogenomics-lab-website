I am a 3rd year student at the University of Bristol, studying Applied Anatomy but wishing to venture into the research of Memory function, or the abnormal function thereof in Parkinson’s Disease. I have been working with Dr Skene to develop the current systematic review and meta-analysis (the registered report of which can be found [here](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=265515)) as well as building the team that has allowed this work to go ahead. We aim to elucidate through statistical analysis, which neuronal regions are most vulnerable to Parkinson’s Disease.
