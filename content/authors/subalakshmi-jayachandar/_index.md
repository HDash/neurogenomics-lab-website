I am a Master's student on the MRes Molecular and Cellular Biosciences programme. This is my second project rotation and my work involves generating the cDNA libraries of various transcription factors in K562 cells. My first project rotation was in the Guerra Lab where I investigated NK-cell mediated preferential killing between two target tumour cells. I received my BSc (Hons) in Biology from the University of York. During this time, I won the Laidlaw Scholarship funding to undertake an independent research project at the York Biomedical Research Institute in the Kaye Lab and I studied the effect of TRIM24 on macrophage surface markers. I also interned in the Sweeney Lab where I generated hCHMP2b DNA constructs for Drosophila genetics studies on FTS/ALS. Through my experiences, I have developed an interest in neuroscience, immunology and molecular genetics. In the future, I aspire to become a neuroimmunologist exploring the cellular and molecular underpinning of depression.
