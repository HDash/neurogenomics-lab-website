I'm currently a master student in translational neuroscience at Imperial College London. I graduated from University of Sydney with a medical science degree, majoring physiology. My desire to understand its pathological mechanisms and identify effective treatments for psychiatric disorders motivated me to explore various areas of neuroscience, genetics and mathematics during my college years. Currently, my research interest is to unravel the genetic basis of these brain disorders using computational approaches. I hope my research results can eventually improve the broad well-being of human society.
