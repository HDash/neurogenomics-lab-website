Prior to joining Imperial, I graduated with an integrated Master’s degree in Pharmacology from the University of Leeds. During my undergraduate degree, I developed an interest in neuropharmacology and subsequently undertook my final year project in a neuroscience lab researching dopaminergic influences on neurogenic niches of the spinal cord.

In 2017/2018, I completed a year in industry, in which I completed two internships. I was based at the Centre of Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, where I was overseeing a study investigating the effects of genetic variance on aspects of nicotine dependence. I also completed an internship at the National Physical Laboratory, exploring the drug delivery efficacy of novel virus-like particles.


Research Interests

The mechanisms underlying the cause of Parkinson’s Disease are currently not well understood - it is thought that a combination of genetics and environmental factors play a role. I am interested in understanding how genetic and environmental risk factors contribute to epigenetic regulation of Parkinson’s. To address this, my project will utilise biochemical approaches such as scRNA seq and ATAC seq, in addition to computational approaches, on post-mortem human brain tissue and a toxicant-exposure rodent model of Parkinson’s


When not in the lab, I can typically be found on the sofa with my nose in a book.
