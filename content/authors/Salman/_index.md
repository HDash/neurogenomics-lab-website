I have a background in Statistics and Data Science, having undertaken my undergraduate degree in Mathematics at Imperial College, London. My main focus during my degree was on Applied Mathematics and Statistics, including some courses on Machine Learning.

After completing my degree, I worked for a year at Oxford's Big Data Institute and their Nuffield Department of Medicine, working as a software developer, mainly dealing with MRI image processing. Here, I also helped develop a Quality Control platform which would allow the user to discard images that were not suitable for use in the pipeline.

For my PhD, I am working with Dr Nathan Skene and Dr Paul Matthews, focusing on the analysis of single-cell data. My main focus will be to try and study how single-cell RNA sequencing can be used to find out more about neurodegenerative diseases, specifically Alzheimer's Disease.
