I am currently studying an MSc in Human and Biological Robotics at Imperial. I previously obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Information and Communication Engineering at Chulalongkorn University. I experienced working as a Data Engineer and Software Engineer developing data pipelines/API for researchers. My main interest lies within the field of Machine learning, Computational Neuroscience, and Bioinformatics. I study how the brain works in both biological and computational aspects while having an opportunity to work on many projects, e.g. Reinforcement Learning, LSTM in real-time anomaly detection, image GANs, and NLP in DNA sequence.

I was inspired by the concept of applying machine learning and deep learning to solve biological problems. Therefore, I am currently strengthening my biology background in order to understand how to apply the computational model to solve the problem in a proper way, especially in the field of epigenetics, hoping to contribute to a deeper understanding of how the brain works.
