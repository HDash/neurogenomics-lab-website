I finished my MSc degree in Bioinformatics at the University of Copenhagen in 2021, after which I spent a year working as a civil servant at <a href="https://www.hus.fi/en/about-us/patient-care-quality-and-patient-safety/hus-diagnostic-center">HUS Diagnostic Center</a> in Helsinki, Finland. Throughout my education, I became increasingly interested in the use of machine learning and large-scale data to increase our understanding of the human biology. Therefore, I was thrilled to join the Skene Lab as a research assistant in September 2022. My work focuses on developing computational methods to preprocess and analyse epigenomic data together with Brian Schilder.
