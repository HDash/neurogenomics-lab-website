I am a third year undergraduate student studying Medical Biosciences at Imperial College London. I am interested in rare and common variants in human diseases. Before joining the lab, I took a two-month summer research experience in Cardiovascular Genetics & Genomics Group at Imperial, working on rare variant curation of genes related to hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy.
Under the supervision of Dr Nathan Skene and Brian Schilder, I am now working on my third year research project about benchmarking of cell type enrichment for genome-wide signature of diseases. I enjoy watching musicals and I am singing soprano in choir.
