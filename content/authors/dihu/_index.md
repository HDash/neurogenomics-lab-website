I conducted my doctoral training at the University of Oxford as a <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/clarendon">Clarendon Scholar</a> in the laboratory of <a href="https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/research/srinivas-group">Professor Shankar Srinivas</a>. There I investigated how transcription factor ETS2 may act as either an oncogene or tumour suppressor, using a combination of single-cell RNA-sequencing, FACS, high resolution fixed and live imaging, ex vivo pharmacological culture, and in vivo CRISPR genetics.

I went on to pursue epigenetic research as a Postdoctoral Scientist in the laboratory of <a href="https://lms.mrc.ac.uk/research-group/reprogramming-and-chromatin/">Professor Petra Hajkova</a> at <a href="https://lms.mrc.ac.uk">London Institute of Medical Sciences MRC</a>. My project involved uncovering molecular triggers for mouse germ cell epigenetic reprogramming using low-input RNA sequencing, FACS, mass spectrometry, embryonic stem cell derivation and directed differentiation, mathematical modelling, and bioinformatic approaches. 

With a long-term goal of studying disease mechanisms of neurodegeneration, I am now investigating cell type specific epigenetic and molecular underpinnings of neurodegenerative disease as a joint Research Associate in the laboratories of Dr Nathan Skene and Dr Sarah Marzi. 

Outside of science, I am a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/clarityharddance">resident DJ</a> by the name '<a href="https://mantissamix.com/an-interview-clarity/">clarity</a>', and I love to cook vegan food.
