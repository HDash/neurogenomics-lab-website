My research focuses on analytic and computational challenges in resolving spatial and temporal properties of brain structure and function. I have worked extensively in neuroimaging, and at the UK DRI at Imperial College, my work focuses on a variety of single cell and spatial transcriptomic techniques that can reveal genomic signatures of the emergence of dementia. My interests include inference on complex neurobiological datasets, multi-study integration and the development of reproducible analysis pipelines. 

I studied mathematics and neuroscience at the University of Melbourne, before completing a PhD based at the Howard Florey Institute focused resolving the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of neural activity as measured by functional MRI.  Moving to the FMRIB Centre, Oxford, I continued working in this field, leading research focused on the conceptual and methodological challenges faced in inferring brain and subjective states from functional measurements, and the clinical translation of these inferences. In particular, I developed protocols for the identification of signatures of drug action and pain and helped to develop analysis pipelines for fMRI and EEG studies of infants.  An Oxford Excellence Fellowship in Paediatric Neuroimaging enabled me to contribute to work on neuroimaging approaches to the measurement of infant pain, targeting clinical trials and clinical monitoring. I have contributed to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) and was Treasurer of the Organisation for Human Brain Mapping Open Science Special Interest Group.  I have ongoing collaborations with Professor Stephen Smith at the Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, Oxford, and with the Paediatric Neuroimaging Group, Oxford.
