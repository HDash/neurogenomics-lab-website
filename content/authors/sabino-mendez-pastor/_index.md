I am an undergraduate student undertaking a BSc in Medical Biosciences at Imperial College London. My interests lie in the neurosciences field, particularly in neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, I am working on a summer research project aiming to identify whether genomic loci associated with frontotemporal dementia map onto specific brain cell types. Under the supervision of Dr Sarah Marzi, I am performing a MAGMA analysis on the results of a GWAS study on frontotemporal dementia to find causative cell types for this complex condition.
