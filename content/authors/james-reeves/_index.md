I am a third year undergraduate studying BSc Medical Biosciences at ICL. I have a strong interest in genetics & genomics, as well as the application of computational biology to neuroscience.
Before joining the lab, I previously gained lab experience in the Infectious Diseases department on St. Marys campus, ICL.
 I am currently undertaking a 20-week project under the supervision of Dr Nathan Skene and Alan Murphy looking at the MungeSumStats formatting package in R and the effect of the increasing number of known non-biallelic SNPs on its function.
