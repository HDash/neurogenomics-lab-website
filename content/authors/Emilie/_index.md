I am currently completing a Masterâ€™s degree in molecular and cell biology at Agrocampus Ouest institute located in Rennes, France. I was able to gain great skills in experimental methods in molecular and cell biology, bioinformatics and data analysis. During my Master, I was part of a pharmaceutical research team for 6 months, which allowed me to discover the field of research and more specifically research in medicine. This reinforced my desire to continue my studies in this direction. I was also very interested in computational science so Neurogenomics was a perfect fit for me as it is very interdisciplinary. I find it fascinating to use computational techniques for data processing in order to answer medical questions.
