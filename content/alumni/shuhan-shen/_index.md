IÂ am currently a master student from MSc Applied Genomics at Imperial. I had my undergraduate at imperial as a biochemist and I found my interest on mental disease, genetics, and bioinformatics. I hope to strengthen my computational knowledge in the future and therefore using computational method to solve genetic problems.
