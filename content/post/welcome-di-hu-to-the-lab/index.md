[Di Hu](https://www.neurogenomics.co.uk/author/di-hu/) has joined the neurogenomics lab this week! She did her PhD at the University of Oxford as a [Clarendon Scholar](https://www.ox.ac.uk/clarendon) in the laboratory of [Professor Shankar Srinivas](https://www.dpag.ox.ac.uk/research/srinivas-group). There she investigated how transcription factor ETS2 may act as either an oncogene or tumour suppressor, using a combination of single-cell RNA-sequencing, FACS, high resolution fixed and live imaging, ex vivo pharmacological culture, and in vivo CRISPR genetics.

She then went on to pursue epigenetic research as a Postdoctoral Scientist in the laboratory of [Professor Petra Hajkova](https://lms.mrc.ac.uk/research-group/reprogramming-and-chromatin/) at [London Institute of Medical Sciences MRC](https://lms.mrc.ac.uk/). Her project involved uncovering molecular triggers for mouse germ cell epigenetic reprogramming using low-input RNA sequencing, FACS, mass spectrometry, embryonic stem cell derivation and directed differentiation, mathematical modelling, and bioinformatic approaches.

She's now joined our lab to work towards her long-term goal of studying disease mechanisms of neurodegeneration. She'll be investigating cell type specific epigenetic and molecular underpinnings of neurodegenerative disease as a joint Research Associate working with both Dr Nathan Skene and Dr Sarah Marzi.

Outside of science, she's also a [resident DJ](https://soundcloud.com/clarityharddance) who goes by the name ‘[clarity](https://mantissamix.com/an-interview-clarity/)’! We're really excited to have her with us.
