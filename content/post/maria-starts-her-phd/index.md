[Maria Tsalenchuk](https://www.neurogenomics.co.uk/author/maria-tsalenchuk//) has just joined the lab as a PhD student! She will work under the supervision of [Dr Sarah Marzi](https://www.neurogenomics.co.uk/author/sarah-marzi/). Maria's project will aim to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms underlying the cause of Parkinson's Disease. In order to address this, Maria will utilise biochemical approaches such as single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq together with computational approaches on post-mortem human brain tissue and a toxicant-exposure rodent model of Parkinson's. 
Prior to joining Imperial, Maria graduated with an integrated Masterâ€™s degree in Pharmacology from the University of Leeds. During her undergraduate degree, Maria developed an interest in neuropharmacology and subsequently undertook her final year project in a neuroscience lab researching dopaminergic influences on neurogenic niches of the spinal cord.
In 2017/2018, Maria completed a year in industry, in which she completed two internships. She was based at the Centre of Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, where Maria was overseeing a study investigating the effects of genetic variance on aspects of nicotine dependence. She also completed an internship at the National Physical Laboratory, exploring the drug delivery efficacy of novel virus-like particles.
When not in the lab, I can typically be found on the sofa with my nose in a book.
