summary: 'Our <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/528463v1">latest
  preprint</a> on cell type mapping is now available on bioRxiv.<br>This work
  was a collaboration with the Hjerling-Leffler and Sullivan labs. Some of the
  most exciting findings relate to Parkinsons disease: we discover genetic
  associations with most the celltypes known to degenerate in the disease
  (suggesting this occurs cell autonomously) but also discovered a new link to
  Oligodendrocytes...'
