We're happy to announce that [Nathan has received a Future Leaders Fellowship](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/204354/future-research-innovation-leaders-awarded-research/) from the UKRI! This award will provide Â£1.5million in funding for the lab over the next four years. It will enable us leverage genetics to drive towards answers to simple questions about brain disorders: where they occur, when the genetic effects act, and how genetic risk affects particular cell types. We are planning to use these funds to build stronger links between the Dementia community and data science / machine learning researchers (building on our links with [the DEMON network](http://demondementia.com/)).
