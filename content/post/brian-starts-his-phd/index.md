[Brian Schilder](https://www.neurogenomics.co.uk/author/brian-schilder/) has joined the lab today as a PhD student! Brian will work under the supervision of [Dr Nathan Skene](https://www.neurogenomics.co.uk/author/nathan-skene/) and his project will focus on automated analysis of single-cell TIP-seq data. 

Brian is a believer in the innovation and insights that can be gained from highly inter-disciplinary research. In 2011, he earned his ScB in Cognitive Neuroscience from Brown University (Providence, RI). The core focus of Brian's work was and continues to be the investigation of human susceptibility to diseases and disorders to impact human health and alleviate suffering. Brian has also worked as a Lab Manager and a Research Assistant at The George Washington University (Washington, DC) where he also earned his MPhil in Human Paleobiology (2017) investigating the neuroanatomical, transcriptomic and genomic evolution of the hippocampus, adult neurogenesis and episodic memory. 
In the pursuit of further advancing my skills as a computational researcher, Brian accepted a position as a Bioinformatician at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (New York City, NY) where he helped to develop a number of open-access bioinformatics tools; e.g. X2K Web, Geneshot, catalogueR, and echolocatoR. Together with his collaborators, Brian has published work revealing cell-type-specific neurogenomic mechanisms underlying neurological conditions (e.g. Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s Disease) through the application of statistical and machine learning techniques to large-scale multi-omics and clinical data. Outside of research, Brian enjoys ultra-marathon running and music production. 
The lab is excited to have Brian onboard and is thrilled to see what his research uncovers!
