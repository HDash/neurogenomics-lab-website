[Will Lunt](https://www.neurogenomics.co.uk/author/will-lunt/) organized a training session for the Skene Lab with Daniela Bultoc and Ana Faro from Imperial's own [People and Organisational Development]("https://www.imperial.ac.uk/staff-development/") team. The training session focused on improving our presentation skills. Daniela and Ana provided us with plenty of insightful tips on how to give impactful presentations on scientific topics that capture and retain the audience's attention. We also learnt how to deal with presentation nerves before and during the presentation and how to improve our presence while presenting. The day was also a nice social team building activity for all of us, and we got to give and get useful feedback on our presentation skills from the lab members. Thanks for Daniela and Ana for the day, and special thanks for Will for organizing the training session!
